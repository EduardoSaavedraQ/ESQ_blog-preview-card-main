## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the second challenge that I tried. I'm keep practicing flexbox because I think it is a powerful tool that is essential to
master.

The hardest part was to select the appropriate tags on the html document. It want to avoid the excesive use of div and span but sometimes Im not sure if this part needs to be inside of the header tag or the main tag.

```html
<header>
  <img src="assets/images/illustration-article.svg" alt="Illustration article image header" id="svg-image">
  <h1><span>Learning</span></h1>

  <p>Published <time datetime="2023-12-24">24 Dec 2023</time></p>
</header>

<main>
  <h2>HTML & CSS foundations</h2>

  <p>These languages are the backbone of every website, defining structure, content, and presentation.</p>
</main>
```

### Continued development

Besides what I mentined above, I want to keep working on responsive design. I want to use media querys only when they're neccesary.
